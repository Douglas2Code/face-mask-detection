  Face masks are crucial in minimizing the propagation of COVID-19, and are highly recommended or even obligatory in many situations.

  This deployed model gives access to dataroots' [open-sourced](https://github.com/datarootsio/face-mask-detection) face mask detection project.

  You can interactively test the model below. Or you can use the model via through our API with the following steps:

  1. Subscribe to this model
  2. Copy your user-id and api-key tokens
  3. Perform the following request

  ```sh
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://${modelversion_id}.users.dploy.ai/ \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --header 'x-api-key: <insert your api key>' \
    --header 'x-api-user: <insert your api id>' \
    --data '{"image": "<insert your base64string>", "type": "png"}'
  ```
